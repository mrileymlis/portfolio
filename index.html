<h2>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>

 <p>My undergraduate degree was a BA in Comparative Literature with a focus on Latin and French. As a result of my work with classical texts, including an undergraduate research position where I assisted in transcribing a 16th century Latin edition of Euripides’ plays, my initial academic interests when entering the MLIS program at UCLA in 2011 were mostly focused on special collections, rare books and preservation. After completing the Fall 2011 quarter, I found myself in need of both a break from academia - having come directly from undergraduate - and more experience outside of academia to better shape my professional interests.<br><br>
I took time off from UCLA with the intention of returning within a few years, but when I returned to the Bay Area, I eventually found a position at bepress, a company which hosts and supports Digital Commons repositories and other forms of open access academic publishing. During my time there, I learned the ins and outs of institutional repositories, the structure and dynamics of academic library administration, graphic design and some coding, and open access scholarship. My work at bepress is what finally spurred me to re-apply to UCLA’s MLIS program in 2017, and I re-entered the program in Fall 2018.<br><br> 
When I returned to UCLA, I was still interested primarily in special collections and rare book preservation. As I started classes with more non-academic experience under my belt, though, I found my interests shifting towards structural issues in LIS, the experiences of LIS workers, and critical theory in LIS. Although I still find special collections and preservation rewarding and worthwhile, my main research interest has coalesced into a focus on labor issues in libraries, archives, and museums (LAM). The labor issue I have found most pressing and most fruitful for further research and advocacy is the proliferation of contingent, grant-funded and precarious labor in LAM institutions. My deepening interest in this trend and its effects on the LIS field led me to apply for and be accepted to the PhD program in Information Studies at UCLA, where I will be continuing to research labor issues in LAM and working with my advisor Dr. Sarah Roberts on commercial content moderator labor.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Special Collections</b><br>
I was hired on in Technical Services at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library in November 2018 and have continued to work there throughout my time at UCLA. As a result both of my position at the Clark as well as coursework in the MLIS program, I’ve become familiar with many aspects of special collections libraries and their collections, workflows, practices and management. My work at the Clark has encompassed activities and tasks such as creating finding aids, processing new archival acquisitions, building a relational database in Microsoft Access, reflagging books in the fine press collection, shelf reads, setting up and breaking down displays of rare books and other materials for public events, and more. It has also taught me valuable “soft skills” for working in teams to complete both short- and long-term projects.
<br>
<br>   
   <b>Preservation and Conservation</b><br>
	During my time in the MLIS program I took two classes with Dr. Ellen Pearlstein on preservation and conservation issues - Issues and Problems in the Preservation of Heritage Materials in Fall 2018, and Environmental Protections of Collections for Museums, Libraries, and Archives in Winter 2020. These courses taught me skills for assessment of collections, disaster preparedness for LAM institutions, restoration of water-damaged materials, environmental monitoring practices and more. This knowledge is useful not only in a practical way for library employment, but also to better understand the labor practices and expectations of LAM workers.
<br>
<br>
   <b>Labor Issues in LIS</b><br>
Working on my MLIS has, by virtue of it being a professional degree, exposed me firsthand to job precarity in LAM - not only in the classroom in a theoretical setting, but through discussions with friends and classmates whose only job opportunities are grant-funded or temporary contracts, and whose situations are even more precarious now because of COVID-19 and the lack of benefits such as health insurance frequently associated with temporary positions.<br><br>
My PhD research will give me the opportunity to address this topic in a new way and to contribute meaningfully both to the scholarly discourse surrounding LAM labor and to the professional community affected by these issues itself. One method of research I am particularly interested in is analyzing job listings and descriptions for LAM workers with the intention of identifying any trends as well as collecting concrete data on things like the percentage of listed positions that are temporary versus permanent. I foresee my research also involving interviews with LAM workers who currently or formerly have held contingent positions.<br><br>
Some research questions I hope to address include: how has precarious labor undermined and devalued LAM professions and workforces? How has the “reification” of information, per Christine Pawley, affected and been affected by contingent labor, neoliberalism, capitalism, etc.? The gig economy is widespread and neoliberalism is present in one way or another in all professions, so why is it important to study the effects of neoliberalism on precarious labor on LAM in particular - that is, what analysis might we miss or misunderstand if we were only to study job precarity today in general?<br><br>
In the short term, my goals include addressing these research questions thoroughly in my time at UCLA and, as a part of that, contributing to the scholarly discourse by collecting up-to-date and useful data on precarious and temporary labor in LAM. I also intend to continue my activity with organized labor, particularly in LAM; agitating for change and empowering unions is essential to reversing the exploitative hiring practices of the gig economy and contract labor. Long-term professional goals include continuing research and publishing relevant scholarship on labor issues in LAM, as well as teaching. I believe that MLIS programs would benefit from formal instruction about these types of labor issues - library management classes often cover labor practices, but not all MLIS programs offer these classes on a regular basis. Labor studies departments and institutes at universities would also benefit from instruction on LAM-specific labor issues; even cross-listed courses between information studies and labor studies departments could be valuable.</p>

<h2>ISSUE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Contingent, temporary, or contract labor, also sometimes referred to as precarious labor, has quickly become the norm for positions in libraries, archives, and other information and memory institutions over recent years. This shift from stable, full-time positions to positions that are short-term contract-based and often without benefits has drastically altered and undermined the professional library and information science (LIS) workforce. Using both critical theory and the grievance filed by UC-AFT on behalf of six temporary archivists at UCLA and its context as a case study, I examine how the mis- and overuse of contingent labor and its precarity negatively impact workers, institutions, and the libraries and archives fields as a whole.</p>

<h2>MAJOR PAPER</h2>
<h3>Neoliberalism, Individualism, and the Perceived Value of Labor in Academic Librarianship</h3>
<p>Spring 2019<br>
IS 213 Current Issues in Librarianship<br>
Professor Gregory Leazer<br>
  <b>Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ</b><br></p>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b><br>
Many of the issues surrounding GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) labor problems trace directly back to the neoliberalization project begun in the 1970s, and indeed are still exacerbated by its results and ongoing process today. For LIS in particular, neoliberal policies and frameworks have had an impact on almost every aspect of the field. In recent years scholarship in the field has been more critical of the role of neoliberalism in LIS, but we must continue this analysis if we hope to properly understand these issues and affect change. A number of scholarly works discuss overarching impacts of neoliberalism in LIS, but this paper focuses specifically on neoliberal attitudes and policies towards labor, especially in higher education and academic libraries.

<h2>ELECTIVE WORK</h2>
<h3>Oakland Museum of California Exhibition Proposal:<br>
<i>The Oakland Black Cowboy Association Parade at 45 Years: Celebrating the History and Communities of the Black American West</i></h3>
<p>Winter 2019<br>
IS 439 Special Collections Seminar<br>
Anna Chen, director of the Clark Library<br>
  <b>Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ</b><br></p>
<p>
<b>Background and Exhibition Overview</b><br>
Black people have been cowboys and cowhands for essentially as long as the profession has existed. Before the abolition of slavery in the United States, having a job as a cowboy offered relative freedom - solo work on horseback, a gun, and more. After the Civil War, thousands of Black Americans migrated westward, and many found work in the cattle industry. Despite the prevalence of Black cowboys - it’s been estimated that in Texas alone between 1866 and 1895, thousands in the cowboy workforce were Black (Pate 2001) - their history has largely been ignored or forgotten in the general history and mythos of the American West. Sporting events like rodeos solidified its imagery, and “the mythology that has been perpetuated about the American West, cowboy culture, and rodeo privileges whiteness and the contributions of Anglo-Americans” (Patton and Schedlock 2011). Despite the relative lack of attention paid to and scholarship on Black cowboys, there is a wealth of stories to be told and many institutions and organizations dedicated to sharing them and rewriting the assumptions inherent in a whiteness-centered Western mythology.<br><br>
One of the organizations dedicated to recentering the Black experience in the history of the western United States, particularly California and what is now the Bay Area, is the Oakland Black Cowboy Association. OBCA has held an annual parade in Oakland since 1974, when the organization was known just as the Black Cowboy Association. 2019 will be the 45th anniversary of the parade and thus an excellent time to celebrate its history, the broader history of Black cowboys and ranchers in California and the West, and today’s generation of Black cowboys and cowgirls.<br><br>
The exhibit will include items from OMCA’s own holdings, including old posters for OBCA’s parade in past years, Juneteenth celebration fliers featuring images of Black cowboys, and other ephemera. Additional objects and materials, such as personal photographs, home movies and sound recordings, should be acquired through consultation and partnership with the community, institutions with related archival materials, and organizations including OBCA and others, such as the Compton Cowboys and Horses in the Hood.<br><br>
Particular attention will be paid to the history and current community of Black cowboys and cowgirls in the Bay Area; although the focus of many Western exhibits are on the men in the cattle and ranching professions, there were also plenty of women cowhands, ropers, and rodeo riders, and that should be acknowledged and reflected in the exhibition content.</p>

<h3>Labor and Workforce Sustainability in Libraries, Archives, and Museums</h3>

<b>Abstract</b><br>
Precarious labor - also often referred to as contingent, temporary, grant-funded, or contract labor - in libraries, archives, and museums (LAM) has been an ongoing issue over the past several decades and has only grown in scope and severity. As full-time jobs are eliminated or made out of reach for all but the most highly qualified and experienced (and often privileged), memory and knowledge institutions like libraries (both public and academic), archives, and museums have filled the void with contract positions. These temporary positions vary in length, but many are grant-funded and thus subject to a finite budget source. Contingent positions such as these also frequently do not provide benefits like healthcare or pension plans or allow for workers in those positions to be represented by the union to which their full-time colleagues may belong. Contingent labor issues are by no means limited to the LAM fields - the rise of the gig economy is proof of that - but precarious labor in LAM has some unique contributing factors and effects. This white paper examines the background and context of the issue and explores potential solutions.</p>

<h3>Neoliberalism, Race, and Social Justice in LIS</h3>

<b>Abstract</b><br>
The library and information science field has long struggled with its overwhelming homogeneity, but it’s only within the last few decades that its deficiencies at the structural level - not just a superficial “diversity” issue - have come under scrutiny. Much of the critical scholarship within and about LIS in this time has approached these fundamental flaws and biases from an anti-racist standpoint; there have also, in more recent years, been more critical pieces regarding the role of capitalism and neoliberalism in the structuring of libraries and archives in the US. Transformational change in LIS, including commitments to anti-racist work and epistemic justice, will require critical analysis of the interwoven nature of racism and neoliberalism in America and its effect on the LIS field. This paper seeks to answer - or at least to begin to unpack - the question of how a critique of neoliberalism can help the LIS field more effectively commit to social justice and anti-racist action.</p><br>
