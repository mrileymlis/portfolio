<h2>ISSUE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Precarious labor, also sometimes referred to as contingent, temporary, or contract labor, has quickly become the norm for positions in libraries, archives, and other information and memory institutions over recent years. This shift from stable, full-time positions to positions that are short-term contract-based and often without benefits has drastically altered and undermined the professional LIS workforce. Using the grievance filed by UC-AFT on behalf of six temporary archivists at UCLA and its context as a case study, I examine how contingent labor and its precarity negatively impacts workers, institutions, and the libraries and archives fields as a whole.</p>

<h2>MAJOR PAPER</h2><br><br>
<h3>Neoliberalism, Individualism, and the Perceived Value of Labor in Academic Librarianship</h3>
<p>Megan Riley, Spring 2019<br>
IS 213 Current Issues in Librarianship<br>
Professor Gregory Leazer
Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ<br><br></p>

<b>Abstract</b><br>
Many of the issues surrounding GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) labor problems trace directly back to the neoliberalization project begun in the 1970s, and indeed are still exacerbated by its results and ongoing process today. For LIS in particular, neoliberal policies and frameworks have had an impact on almost every aspect of the field. In recent years scholarship in the field has been more critical of the role of neoliberalism in LIS, but we must continue this analysis if we hope to properly understand these issues and affect change. A number of scholarly works discuss overarching impacts of neoliberalism in LIS, but this paper focuses specifically on neoliberal attitudes and policies towards labor, especially in higher education and academic libraries.
