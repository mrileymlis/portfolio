<h2>ISSUE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Precarious labor, also sometimes referred to as contingent, temporary, or contract labor, has quickly become the norm for positions in libraries, archives, and other information and memory institutions over recent years. This shift from stable, full-time positions to positions that are short-term contract-based and often without benefits has drastically altered and undermined the professional LIS workforce. Using the grievance filed by UC-AFT on behalf of six temporary archivists at UCLA and its context as a case study, I examine how contingent labor and its precarity negatively impacts workers, institutions, and the libraries and archives fields as a whole.</p>

<h2>MAJOR PAPER</h2>
<h3>Neoliberalism, Individualism, and the Perceived Value of Labor in Academic Librarianship</h3>
<p>Spring 2019<br>
IS 213 Current Issues in Librarianship<br>
Professor Gregory Leazer<br>
  <b>Δ Δ Δ Δ Δ</b><br></p>
<p>
<b>Abstract</b><br>
Many of the issues surrounding GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) labor problems trace directly back to the neoliberalization project begun in the 1970s, and indeed are still exacerbated by its results and ongoing process today. For LIS in particular, neoliberal policies and frameworks have had an impact on almost every aspect of the field. In recent years scholarship in the field has been more critical of the role of neoliberalism in LIS, but we must continue this analysis if we hope to properly understand these issues and affect change. A number of scholarly works discuss overarching impacts of neoliberalism in LIS, but this paper focuses specifically on neoliberal attitudes and policies towards labor, especially in higher education and academic libraries.

<h2>ELECTIVE WORK</h2>
<h3>Oakland Museum of California Exhibition Proposal:<br>
<i>The Oakland Black Cowboy Association Parade at 45 Years: Celebrating the History and Communities of the Black American West</i></h3>
<p>Winter 2019<br>
IS 439 Special Collections Seminar<br>
Anna Chen, director of the Clark Library<br>

<p>
<b>Background and Exhibition Overview</b><br>
Black people have been cowboys and cowhands for essentially as long as the profession has existed. Before the abolition of slavery in the United States, having a job as a cowboy offered relative freedom - solo work on horseback, a gun, and more. After the Civil War, thousands of Black Americans migrated westward, and many found work in the cattle industry. Despite the prevalence of Black cowboys - it’s been estimated that in Texas alone between 1866 and 1895, thousands in the cowboy workforce were Black (Pate 2001) - their history has largely been ignored or forgotten in the general history and mythos of the American West. Sporting events like rodeos solidified its imagery, and “the mythology that has been perpetuated about the American West, cowboy culture, and rodeo privileges whiteness and the contributions of Anglo-Americans” (Patton and Schedlock 2011). Despite the relative lack of attention paid to and scholarship on Black cowboys, there is a wealth of stories to be told and many institutions and organizations dedicated to sharing them and rewriting the assumptions inherent in a whiteness-centered Western mythology.<br><br>
One of the organizations dedicated to recentering the Black experience in the history of the western United States, particularly California and what is now the Bay Area, is the Oakland Black Cowboy Association. OBCA has held an annual parade in Oakland since 1974, when the organization was known just as the Black Cowboy Association. 2019 will be the 45th anniversary of the parade and thus an excellent time to celebrate its history, the broader history of Black cowboys and ranchers in California and the West, and today’s generation of Black cowboys and cowgirls.<br><br>
The exhibit will include items from OMCA’s own holdings, including old posters for OBCA’s parade in past years, Juneteenth celebration fliers featuring images of Black cowboys, and other ephemera. Additional objects and materials, such as personal photographs, home movies and sound recordings, should be acquired through consultation and partnership with the community, institutions with related archival materials, and organizations including OBCA and others, such as the Compton Cowboys and Horses in the Hood.<br><br>
Particular attention will be paid to the history and current community of Black cowboys and cowgirls in the Bay Area; although the focus of many Western exhibits are on the men in the cattle and ranching professions, there were also plenty of women cowhands, ropers, and rodeo riders, and that should be acknowledged and reflected in the exhibition content.</p>

<h3>Labor and Workforce Sustainability in Libraries, Archives, and Museums</h3>

<b>Abstract</b><br>
Precarious labor - also often referred to as contingent, temporary, grant-funded, or contract labor - in libraries, archives, and museums (LAM) has been an ongoing issue over the past several decades and has only grown in scope and severity. As full-time jobs are eliminated or made out of reach for all but the most highly qualified and experienced (and often privileged), memory and knowledge institutions like libraries (both public and academic), archives, and museums have filled the void with contract positions. These temporary positions vary in length, but many are grant-funded and thus subject to a finite budget source. Contingent positions such as these also frequently do not provide benefits like healthcare or pension plans or allow for workers in those positions to be represented by the union to which their full-time colleagues may belong. Contingent labor issues are by no means limited to the LAM fields - the rise of the gig economy is proof of that - but precarious labor in LAM has some unique contributing factors and effects. This white paper examines the background and context of the issue and explores potential solutions.</p>

<h3>Neoliberalism, Race, and Social Justice in LIS</h3>

<b>Abstract</b><br>
The library and information science field has long struggled with its overwhelming homogeneity, but it’s only within the last few decades that its deficiencies at the structural level - not just a superficial “diversity” issue - have come under scrutiny. Much of the critical scholarship within and about LIS in this time has approached these fundamental flaws and biases from an anti-racist standpoint; there have also, in more recent years, been more critical pieces regarding the role of capitalism and neoliberalism in the structuring of libraries and archives in the US. Transformational change in LIS, including commitments to anti-racist work and epistemic justice, will require critical analysis of the interwoven nature of racism and neoliberalism in America and its effect on the LIS field. This paper seeks to answer - or at least to begin to unpack - the question of how a critique of neoliberalism can help the LIS field more effectively commit to social justice and anti-racist action.</p><br>
